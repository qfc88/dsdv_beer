# Introduction 
Our project researched and visualized how country and associated data of beer consumption have changed. We grabbed the alcohol recorded per capita consumption by countries for each year, and used method of estimation to analyze a variety of metrics. Users can interactively choose a year range they are interested in to get a closer look at subtleties.

A joint project between Do Hieu, Tran Khang, Quang Phuoc, and Thanh Phuong.
